## Overview

This repository contains AI-powered content analysis systems designed to provide comprehensive insights into written content.

## Components

### HIFE (Human Insight Fusion Engine)

An advanced AI system designed to convert large written artefacts (blogs, emails, essays, transcripts, etc.) into multidimensional, humane, growth-oriented insight reports.

**Key Features:**
- Multidimensional analysis across linguistics, emotion, personality, cognition, social dynamics, values, expertise, and growth patterns
- Human-centered approach with radical respect for dignity, nuance, and context
- Comprehensive reporting with confidence scores and limitations
- Safety-first design with bias scanning and ethical safeguards

**Analysis Modules:**
- **Linguistics (LING)**: Readability, lexical diversity, stylometry, cohesion
- **Emotion (EMO)**: Sentiment analysis, affect mapping, empathy cues
- **Personality (PSY)**: Big Five, MBTI, Enneagram, attachment styles
- **Cognition (COG)**: Analytical vs. intuitive preferences, systems thinking
- **Social Dynamics (SOC)**: Persuasion, conflict style, leadership indicators
- **Values & Worldview (VAL)**: Value hierarchy, moral foundations, cultural lens
- **Expertise & Knowledge (EXP)**: Domain topics, depth vs. breadth
- **Growth Trajectory (GTH)**: Self-reflection, goal orientation, resilience
- **Risk Flags (RSK)**: Burnout, stress, ethical concerns

### ContentAnalyzer
